the previous version has to be uninstalled first: 
 
```
./deploy/kubernetes-latest/cleanup.sh
```

Then, a new version can be deployed, by following either one of the procedures below:
- [helm public repo](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/csi-wekafs/csi-wekafsplugin) (recommended)
- [deploy script](./README.md)
- [helm local installation](deploy/helm/csi-wekafsplugin/LOCAL.md)
